# Workout-Tracker

## Overview 
This application, Workout-Tracker will allow a user to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user will also be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The tracker allows the user to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it will track the distance traveled.
